# Challenge 7 Work Day Scheduler 

## Description

In this challenge, I was tasked to create a simple calender application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying a given stater code.It was powered by jQuery. The[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library was used to work with date and time. 


## steps taken

1. Created a new GitHub repo called `WorkDaySchedular`. Then, cloned it to my computer.

2. Copied the starter files into my local git repository.

## Tasks

1. Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner

2. Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

3. Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed. Not completed this task yet

4.  Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

5. Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

6. Persist events between refreshes of a page
